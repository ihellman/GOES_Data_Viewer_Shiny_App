# GOES Data Viewer Shiny App

A very basic shiny app that pulls raw GOES telemetry data from an external source, cleans it, and displays two tables.  One table for SedEvent Data and one for Met Station.  The reason for this app is to try and make a single location for checking SedEvent and Met Station telmetry data compared to going to FTS360 and the GOES portal separately. The incoming raw data for each table is different and requires slightly different cleaning.  Currently, the code is pulling the data from a shared CSV file hosted on ownCloud.  Some sample data of what is being pulled from ownCloud is provided in the sample_data folder.
